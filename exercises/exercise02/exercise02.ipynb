    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The District Court of Maryland provides data on eviction-related court filings on the [Maryland Open Data Portal](https://opendata.maryland.gov/Housing/District-Court-of-Maryland-Eviction-Case-Data/mvqb-b4hf/about_data), and the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) summarizes these data on a [dashboard](https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiYWI1Yzg0YjYtNDFkZS00MDUyLThlMDctYmE1ZjY5MGI0MWJhIiwidCI6IjdkM2I4ZDAwLWY5YmUtNDZlNy05NDYwLTRlZjJkOGY3MzE0OSJ9&pageName=ReportSection). This dashboard includes some helpful information about filing types and how the eviction process works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite efforts to make eviction data public, the eviction process is complicated and the data are messy and technical, making them difficult to understand. Take, for example, how the table represents evictions: each row represents a court filing, but only some of these filings indicate an eviction (`'Event Type' == 'Warrant of Restitution - Return of Service - Evicted'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please help DHCD summarize the filings to understand how tenants are impacted by the eviction process, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***(I demo this below)*** How many unique cases get filed each month?\n",
    "2. ***(You do)*** What percent of cases end in eviction?\n",
    "3. ***(You do)*** Do cases of different types (e.g., tennant holding over, breach of lease, failure to pay rent) culminate in eviction at different rates?\n",
    "4. ***(Optional)*** How long, on average, does it take for cases to move from a petition being filed to warrent of restitution?\n",
    "5. ***(Optional)*** What is the eviction rate per person per year at the county level? Which county has a higher rate?\n",
    "6. ***(Optional)*** Are there other interesting ways you can summarize these data?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these questions, you will need to familiarize yourself with how the data are structured, including what each row represents (see above), what data are stored in each column, how consistently these data are structured into categories, etc. You may have to convert data types, correct inconsistencies in categories or simplify how categories are represented, change names of columns so they're intuitive, or do other data wrangling to make the data easier to work with. Then you will have to group/aggregate the data by one or more dimensions to make summary calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend approaching this in two phases: \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, write a general-purpose function that takes the raw table as an input——you can decide whether the argument to this function is a path to the CSV or a Pandas DataFrame into which you have already the CSV--and cleans it up into a tidy dataframe that is easy to use for the second phase and for future analyses. You can imagine using this function as a handy pre-processor whenever you download an updated copy of the eviction data. ***I started writing this function for you below, but you can modify or add to it to fit your purposes.***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, write multiple single-purpose functions (though there may be opportunities to generalize) that take your tidy dataframe as an input and do calculations with it to address each of the questions above. ***I wrote an example function to answer the first question above—how many unique cases get filed each month? You try writing functions for questions 2–3. 4–6 are optional if you want an extra challenge.***\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may also write additional helper functions that are called by your main functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Included in this folder are the three CSVs I used in Demo 4: \n",
    "- `District_Court_of_Maryland_Eviction_Case_Data_MG_PG.csv`: Court filings for Montgomery and Prince George's County. I recommend starting with these filings as a 'minimal example.' Ideally, your code will be able to handle filings from other counties or the whole state if they are provided in the same format. You are welcome to try using data from the whole state, but it's not required. ***To economize storage space on GitHub, please don't commit statewide data in your pull request.***\n",
